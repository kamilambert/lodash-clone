Common JS Utility Functions [Lodash]

## Context
This project will take you into the realm of real a JavaScript library used by thousands (maybe millions) of developers across the world. You’ll have to think like an open-source software developer and learn the benefits and constraints of such a role.

In addition, your code may be used by other developers to make their jobs easier. Hopefully this project helps you better understand how to contribute to the open source community so that you can be an active member throughout your career.

The questions that this project will raise are:

What happens “under the hood” of the most common utility functions?
How do we write packages that are easy to understand and simple to use out of the box?
How to publish a package to NPM? (part of stretch goal)
This goal is the sister goal of Common JS Utility Functions - Underscore.

## Specifications
[x] Tests and correct implementations exist for 32 (not all) utility functions from the Lodash library.<br>

[x] All code is written with ES2015.<br>
[x] Includes a README listing each method written and which file it is in.<br>
[x] Code uses a linter and there are no linting errors.<br>
[x] Code is well tested and all tests are passing.<br>
[x] All dependencies are properly declared in package.json.<br>
[x] All major features are added via pull requests with a clear description and concise commit messages.<br>
[x] Every pull request has been reviewed by at least one other person.<br>
[x] The artifact produced is properly licensed, preferably with the MIT license.

## Stretch
[ ] An additional 16 utility functions have tests and correct implementations.<br>
[x] Package is published to NPM.<br>
[ ] All source code has inline documentation using JSDoc format.<br>
[ ] Documentation is published a simple GitHub Pages site (hint: use a builder like the documentation package).
